    <p>
      Here at charity: water, we firmly believe that everyone should have access to clean, drinkable water. Yet, this crisis hasn't been dealt with, but with your help and those around you, we can change that. With over 700 million people in need of clean drinking water, we need strong-minded individuals to act and join our cause in fighting this crisis. As long as you have hope in us, charity: water can turn it into reality.
